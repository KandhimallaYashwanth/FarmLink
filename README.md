## Overview
FarmLink is a self-contained web platform that facilitates direct trade between agricultural producers and purchasers. The solution operates completely within the browser environment, leveraging localStorage for persistent data storage between sessions.

The platform establishes two distinct marketplace views:
- **For Farmers**: Displays all buyer purchase requests
- **For Buyers**: Shows all farmer product listings

Built as a single-page application, FarmLink provides real-time interaction capabilities while maintaining full client-side operation. The interface combines functional minimalism with agricultural aesthetic elements for an intuitive user experience.

## How It Works
1. **Farmers/Buyers** create posts via modal
2. Posts automatically appear in the opposite user type's marketplace
3. Users can:
   - Message each other
   - Manage their own posts
   - Update profiles
